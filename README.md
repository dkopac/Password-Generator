# Password-Generator

This weeks challenge i was assisted with a tutor by the name of Tudor Tocan. He helped me modify the code to make it user friendly. Adding all the elements to ensure the password had all the necessary characters. My instructor also helped me tweak my final issues that i was having when i ended up creating the for loop and it was infinite.
